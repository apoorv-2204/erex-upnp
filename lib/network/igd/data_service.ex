  # UPnP Root Device -A physical device can contain one or more root devices. Root devices contain one ore more devices. A
  # root device is modeled with a UPnPDevice object, there is no separate interface defined for root devices.
  #
  # UPnP Device - The representation of a UPnP device. A UPnP device may contain other UPnP devices and UPnP services.This
  # entity is represented by a UPnPDevice object. A device can be local (implemented in the Framework) or external (implemented
  # by another device on the net).
  #
  # UPnP Service -A UPnP device consists of a number of services. A UPnP service has a number of UPnP state variables that can be
  # queried and modified with actions. This concept is represented by a UPnPService object.
  #
  # UPnP State Variable - A variable associated with a UPnP service, represented by a UPnPStateVariable object.
  #
  # UPnP Local State Variable - Extends the UPnPStateVariable interface when the state variable is implemented locally.
  # provides access to the actual value.
  #
  # UPnP Event Listener Service - A listener to events coming from UPnP devices.
  #
  # UPnP Host - The machine that hosts the code to run a UPnP device or control point.
  #
  # UPnP Control Point - A UPnP device that is intended to control UPnP devices over a network.(a UPnP remote controller).
  #
  # UPnP Exception - An exception that delivers errors that were discovered in the UPnP layer.
  #
  # UDN - Unique Device Name, a name that uniquely identifies the a specific device.

  #  WANPPPConnection
  #
  # WANPPPConnection is a UPnP service that allows clients to configure and manage PPP connections on a UPnP Â (IGD).
  # The UPnP Device Architecture specification, which is a set of specifications for UPnP devices, defines it.
  # The WANPPPConnection service allows you to execute a variety of actions on a PPP connection,including changing
  # the connection type (e.g., PPPoE, PPTP, L2TP), configuring connection parameters (e.g., username, password,
  # authentication type), and creating or terminating the connection.
  #
  # Clients can access the WANPPPConnection service to manage PPP connections on a UPnP IGD programmatically,
  # for example, to connect to the Internet or a virtual private network (VPN). The control interface of the service
  # is normally accessed over HTTP, using a URL supplied in the IGD's device description.

  # WANCommonInterfaceConfig
  #
  # Defined in UPnP Device Architecture specification
  #  The WANCommonInterfaceConfig service allows you to execute a variety of activities on the common interface, such
  #  as retrieving and setting the connection type and status, as well as receiving interface statistics. The common
  #  interface connects the IGD to the wide area network (WAN), and it is used to connect to the Internet or other
  #  WAN resources.
  # Clients can utilise the WANCommonInterfaceConfig service to control the common interface on a UPnP IGD programmatically,
  # such as monitoring connection status or changing connection settings. The control interface of the service is normally
  # accessed over HTTP, using a URL supplied in the IGD's device description.
